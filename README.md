### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eliza, an aspiring software engineer and career changer, focusing on Javascript, React and Ruby on Rails. I graduated from the Flatiron School's Software Engineering program and am looking to join a team to put my new skills to work.  

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects to keep my skills sharp.  Right now I am building a React ToDo app that will utilize hooks, which I have not worked with yet.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create small games as a way to keep working on my skills.
