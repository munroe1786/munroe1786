### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eliza, an aspiring software engineer and career changer, focusing on Javascript, React and Ruby on Rails. I graduated from the Flatiron School's Software Engineering program and am looking to join a team to put my new skills to work.  In between applying to jobs and learning new skills, I help look after my nieces and nephew and also help with my sister and brother-in-law's two dogs by walking them all over the neighborhood.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects to keep my skills sharp.  Right now I am building a React ToDo app that will utilize hooks, which I have not worked with yet.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create small games as a way to keep working on my skills.  APIs are also something that I am working on learning more about by building apps that utilize API calls.  I plan to learn Java soon as well.

âš¡ Fun facts: I used to bake bread at a cafe in Athens, GA and stil do now and again.  I also played cello in middle and high school and would like to take it up again soon.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: my email address is era3munroe at gmail dot com.
